<h2>Projects, Seminars and material</h2>
In this page I expose some of the material I've prepared and I'm producing during my university journey.
I share my thesis, my seminars and more. Some of the material is written in english and some of the material is written in italian.

	 <summary><a href="https://github.com/robyBorelli/Seminars/blob/main/reports/3sum.pdf">The 3SUM problem admits subquadratic solutions</a></summary>
	 <b>Abstract: </b> In this work, I consider the 3sum problem. Recent yearsâ€™ studies have shown that the problem admits a subquadratic solution. The 3sum problem has been used in the area of fine-grained complexity to establish lower bounds to a wide range of other problems (which have shown to be 3sum-hard) for example in the computational geometry area. In this paper, I examine the Freund approach to obtain a subquadratic algorithm. To obtain a saving in the complexity, several tricks have been applied and in particular it has been shown how to efficiently enumerate the so-called chunks through a correspondence with paths in a matrix and then all pairs of blocks agreeing with such derived chunks are obtained through a reduction to the dominance-merge problem.
