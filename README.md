<h2>Projects, Seminars and material</h2>
In this page I expose some of the material I've prepared and I'm producing during my university journey.
I share my thesis, my seminars and more. Some of the material is written in english and some of the material is written in italian.

	 <b>Type: </b> Publication<br>
	 <b>Language: </b> English<br>
	 <b>Abstract: </b> Entropy of multivariate distributions may be estimated based on the distances of nearest neighbours from each sample from a statistical ensemble. This technique has been applied on biomolecular systems for estimating both conformational and translational/rotational entropy. The degrees of freedom which mostly define conformational entropy are torsion angles with their periodicity. In this work, tree structures and algorithms to quickly generate lists of nearest neighbours for periodic and non-periodic data are reviewed and applied to biomolecular conformations as described by torsion angles. The effect of dimensionality, number of samples, and number of neighbours on the computational time is assessed. The main conclusion is that using proper data structures and algorithms can greatly reduce the complexity of nearest neighbours lists generation, which is the bottleneck step in nearest neighbours entropy estimation.

	 <b>Type: </b> Seminar for the course "Advanced Algorithms"<br>
	 <b>Language: </b> English<br>
	 <b>Abstract: </b> In this work, I consider the 3sum problem. Recent years’ studies have shown that the problem admits a subquadratic solution. The 3sum problem has been used in the area of fine-grained complexity to establish lower bounds to a wide range of other problems (which have shown to be 3sum-hard) for example in the computational geometry area. In this paper, I examine the Freund approach to obtain a subquadratic algorithm. To obtain a saving in the complexity, several tricks have been applied and in particular it has been shown how to efficiently enumerate the so-called chunks through a correspondence with paths in a matrix and then all pairs of blocks agreeing with such derived chunks are obtained through a reduction to the dominance-merge problem.

	 <b>Type: </b> Seminar for the course "Automatic system Verification: Theory and Applications"<br>
	 <b>Language: </b> English<br>
	 <b>Abstract: </b> In this work, I consider the expressive power of various temporal logics. First, I recall some basic results about expressiveness of first order logic. Then I consider the case of LTL and I show a theorem that can be used to prove that the concept of parity is not definable in this context. I discuss a counterexample that proves that the mentioned theorem doesn’t directly apply to LTL+P and I briefly highlight how a possible investigation may lead to a generalization of the theorem to the LTL+P case. Next, I relate first order definable languages with LTL ones and I present an extension to LTL which allows us to increase the expressive power and capture regular languages without changing the complexity of the decision procedure. Finally, I move to the more interesting case of interval logic. I introduce the notion of bisimulation and its use in modal logic and, in particular, I show how to apply it to prove that the logic PNL is strictly more expressive than its future fragment A.
